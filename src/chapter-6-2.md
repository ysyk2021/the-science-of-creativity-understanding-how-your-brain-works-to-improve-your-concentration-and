By using these criteria to evaluate and compare ideas, we can select the ones that have the greatest potential for success.

Developing Your Own Criteria

While there are common criteria that can be used in idea selection, it is also important to develop your own criteria based on your unique situation and needs. Some questions to consider when developing your own criteria can include:

* What are our organization's specific goals and priorities?
* What resources do we have available to implement these ideas?
* How feasible is it to implement these ideas within our current constraints?
* How original and innovative are these ideas compared to existing solutions?

By developing your own criteria, you can ensure that you are evaluating ideas based on what is most important for your organization and situation.
